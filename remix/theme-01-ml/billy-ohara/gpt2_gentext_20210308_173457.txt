Will you excuse my poor state when I not only am gone, but have reign
  over the thing that life doth shake from me,
  That hath nothing to prove but power,
  Upon your part to do me disgrace?
  Have I not seen the tyrant take pleasure
  And make me do the thing I most do wish done,
  And do me such as that which you graven:
    For I have seen him who lives solely on his gains;
    For he is so fond on what he enjoys that he doth invent
    Revenge upon those he doth bashe in mercy,
    That is his painting even to his sad house.

  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
  While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
  Reserve their character with golden quill,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
  I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
  And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
  Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
  And to the most of praise add something more;
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
  Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

  LXXXVI

  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
====================
  More than beauty's truth, my love
  Tell me thou art false of heart, that thou dost lie,
  And I an accessary to precious life,
  That destin'd fleeting moment when thou dost tell.
  So dost thou try to make me one thing
  True and true of thy false art,; me another being.
  So dost thou on the cross, that feeds on
  My verse, and all that it contains,
  Making me speak true, of things unseen,
  Making me his guest in his banquet.
    This worship, so oft in my verse,
    To this false I write this, this lie,
    To this wide rondure that the world doth dwell.

  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
  And all my soul, and all my every part;
  And for this sin there is no remedy,
  It is so grounded inward in my heart.
  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
  And for myself mine own worth do define,
  As I all other in all worths surmount.
  But when my glass shows me myself indeed
  Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
  Self so self-loving were iniquity.
    'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,
    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

  LXIII

  Against my love shall be as I am now,
  With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
  When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
  With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
  Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
  Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
  For such a time do I now fortify
  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  That he shall never cut from memory
  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
   
====================
  And then begins the second part of the rhyme,
  In lovely lines of his, where life's proudst defect
  Bites each in each region, till each hesitates
  While he in each lays a new dilemma:
  So do our faults, which have grown old,
  Showcase beauty, and showcase frailties which no frailer pen
  Can enlighten with gentle truth. Love's fault lies not in thy wit,
  But in thy goodness, and in thy haste:
    And how can thy great love be praised if thou art so slow
    That thou art condemned to bitter despatch?
    So are you, or you both, if not me for this verse
    Were better writers than this,
    Because I have thy back, or you both for that matter.

  CXLIV

  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
  Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
  The better angel is a man right fair,
  The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
  To win me soon to hell, my female evil,
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
  And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
  But being both from me, both to each friend,
  I guess one angel in another's hell:
    Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

  CXLV

  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
  To me that languish'd for her sake:
  But when she saw my woeful state,
  Straight in her heart did mercy come,
  Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
  Was us'd in giving gentle doom;
  And taught it thus anew to greet;
  'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
  That followed it as gentle day,
  Doth follow night, who like a fiend
  From heaven to hell is flown away.

====================
  All men make faults, and even I in this,
  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--
  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--
  And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
    That I an accessary needs must be,
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

  XXXVI

  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
  Although our undivided loves are one:
  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
  In our two loves there is but one respect,
  Though in our lives a separable spite,
  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  XXXVII

  As a decrepit father takes delight
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
  For whether beauty do or power do please
  To play the mother's part, and make me woe when I lose her:
  Thou art the grave where my sweet son buried her,
  And I the top of happy-goes wheretimes be;
  So I, lame and dost ill for comfort,
  Look in the glass and say 'This is not love,'
  And that evil eye that doth my music play,
  That hath no part in my love's making known;
    To leave open the grave where thou art buried thou wilt be buried;
    But where thou art, where thou art not, thou art me.
====================
which I sometime add a peeks to beauty's best.
  Even so, having beauty's best, why should I shun
  Thy most precious jewel, which now seems wilt?
  Why should I chide thy beauty, who for all his wealth doth
  Spend his wealth in newer and sillier tricks?
  Why should I maiden be swerving to my
  Wretched-proud captain's seat, to leap?
  Why should I mother ship with my child,
  To the race of gorgeous women to leap?
  Why should I let my child's beauty win,
  When sav'd of all his glory and proud of his boast:
    And so of you, a modern shame cackles.

at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time
and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank

====================
  The sea-going monarch fears that if he cannot see,
  The storm-beaten king might leave thee.
  So thou, thyself outlived, let him see,
  As he takes glimpses of thee, let him see thy face;
  But if thou take thy self all in,
  And thy self thy friend, make some special instant special-blest,
  For that precious jewel which doth this purpose shine.
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
    This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

  XXXVIII

  How can my muse want subject to invent,
  While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
  O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

  XXXIX

  O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separation I may give
  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
  O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    By praising him here who doth hence remain.

  The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
  Is lust in action: and till action, lust
  Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
  Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
  Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
  Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
  Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
  Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;
  A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;
  Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

  CXVII

  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
  To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
  Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
  'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
  For no man well of such a salve can speak,
  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
  The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
    Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
    And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.

  CXVIII

  No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  All men make faults, and even I in this,
  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins more than
====================
    And all for thy sake paying the whole:
    Buy'd ill will on me for my defects,
    Since I am elsewhere, besides: for whom should they spend?
    To detain those whom nature hath not made for store,
    And whom she hath put in her gems-part,
    To make him his mortgag'd cradle?
    To keep him that travels with him I'll travel,
    And let him stay: I will not let him go unsway,
    Unless thou take that which goes well with thee.

  CXXVI

  Art thou so unkind as to dwell alone,
  Canst thou therefore live by thy self, live by thyself alone?
  Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
  Nay, if thou do dote me, do I swear thee alive,
  Even when thou thy self dost play the tyrant?
  What merit do I in my self respect,
  That is so proud thy service to despise,
  When all my best doth worship thy defect,
  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

  CXXVII

  O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
  Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;
  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
  May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
  Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
  She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
    And her quietus is to render thee.

  CXXVIII

  In the old age black was not counted fair,
  Or if it were, it bore not beauty
====================
    Yet with these o'erlooked blessings lies my love,
    Since all alike my songs and praises be
    Have suffic'd still, and I in their cheerfulness
    As if nothing had gone so.

  LXXXIX

  O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separation I may give
  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
  O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    By praising him here who doth hence remain.

  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.
  Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,
  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;
  But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest
  By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
  I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
  And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
  To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

that disperse'd like weeds,
 that forage far-raz'd,
 whereof are’quarters of a state,
 whereof are absent, and whereof fresh
  Nay part the heaven whereon thou art held,
  To the ocean, whereon fresh flowers are grown;
  But my sun, dimm'd, fad’ing day,
  Doth daily set amiss, and stops short’ing night,
  To set a form upon desired new,
  Which like a weed now is set new young,

    As all those who were with me before me are,’
    And bear witness to this, by thy show:

  Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  That they behold, and see not what they see?
  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
  Yet what the best is take the worst to be.’
  If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
  Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
  Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?’
  Why should my heart think that a several plot,
  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?’
  Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
  To put fair truth upon so foul a face?’
    In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,’’
    And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.’’
    And me of you, mine eyes are false in their false conceit
    And me of you, them too are my heart's verdict.

  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
  I do believe her though I know she lies,
  That she might think me some untutor'd youth,

====================
Tired of your silence,
  Awakes my heart to sing,
  And then heart in my thoughts as loud
  As you can make them win.
  I have no words to express what is said,
  But you have powers of speech, and you can write,
  To make a story tell of things' past,
  Such as no book can contain,
  Making a story of lords and ladies,
  And of great ladies' lives so brief did they lie,
  How like the waves in the oceanic canker do they gather,
  Making a summer's story tell,
  That proves more than a summer's play,
  That makes summer's story tell of lovers,
    And all things gay with lovers o'er bless'd be.

  CVII

  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
  Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
  And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
  Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
  My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
  While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

  CVIII

  What's in the brain, that ink may character,
  Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?
  What's new to speak, what now to register,
  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
  Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
  I must each day say o'er the very same;
  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
  Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
 
====================
I think of all your favourites,
  And nothing stands that will stop my story
  From becoming a story of love,
  Making old offences of affections return.
  Love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  And he that trusts you, will soon be trusted well;
  He may boast of our time, and say we love thee now;
  But he that calls on thee, shall soon be dead;
  And all those that love and adored you in 'Will.'
    Those are the roses that glazed the field where I grew.
    Till I forgot them was the year the roses did see,
    And you will remember them fondly as well.

  CXXXV

  When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
  With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
  Upon thy part I can set down a story
  Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
  That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
  And I by this will be a gainer too;
  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  The injuries that to myself I do,
  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.

  CXXXVI

  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
  And I will comment upon that offence:
  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
  Against thy reasons making no defence.
  Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
  To set a form upon desired change,
  As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
  I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
  Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
  Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
    For
====================
I have seen thy days;
  And sometime warm blood, as thou never cold,
  Doth lend, and other times not loan,
  To me for sacred love, at random doth Sons
  Describe the best of your kind, and me for you,
  Mark how with their likeness thou art made.
  How hard can a gilded tomb hold,
  When precious life itself doth rehearse,
  That such a man can make such a tomb
  As slow as death?
  How many a holy and obsequious tear
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
  As interest of the dead, which the Philistines
  Never again will reign in heaven.
    But true hearts, by their looks, us'd ever so unkind,
    We are so strongly in his feature, that he is hard
    To show or hide an ill.

  LXXXVI

  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
  These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
  Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
  Time's thievish progress to eternity.
  Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

  LXXXVII

  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
  The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
  But then begins a journey in my head
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
  For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
  Save that my soul's imaginary sight
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
====================
  When I was old, tender-pied Nature's best buds burthen my field;
  And her quieted winds and gentle water,
  Which overgrown with too much pride
  Gav'd thee by warning to her let me go;
  Because I had thy love, and she thy love,
  And such faults as this have besotted me straight;
    So shall I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
    If thou turn me back again, that I may return again.

  CXLV

  My love is as a fever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease;
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
  My reason, the physician to my love,
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
  Desire is death, which physic did except.
  Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
  My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
  At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

  CXLVI

  Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
  My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
  Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
  Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
  Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
  Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
  And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
  Within be fed, without be rich no more:
    So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
    And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

  CXLVII

  My love is as a fever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease;
  Feeding
====================
I have seen the stars dim
  And I straighteous believe that they are now
  Doth for Gilding and Doth for Gilding's waste;
  And yet, love knows it is not so;
  The stars do not make but vanity loves show,
  So true as all dumb superstitions are.
    Love, what possess'd thy soul with thy glance to behold,
    Though thy blind taste show thee it was WRONG,
    To gaze on it that used to wow.

  CXLIV

  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
  Now is the time that face should form another;
  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
  For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
  Of his self-love to stop posterity?
  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
  Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
    But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
    Die single and thine image dies with thee.

  CXLV

  If my beloved angel be dead, what good can me of thee
  For still life thou still bear, which gives thy soul
  Time's welcome torment?
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
  Of his self-love to stop posterity?
  O! my beloved, what tenderage canst thou leave
  Which gives thy soul welcome to the heaven of dreams?
  O! patience, what fastidious shall thou pour
  Of defects which life cannot repair?
  O! sweetness, which thou incapable canst repair?
    O! youth, which can deliver himself from this torture.

  CXLVI

  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
  Although our undivided loves are one:
  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.

    Then thank him not for that which he did say,

  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
  While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
  Reserve their character with golden quill,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
  I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
  And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
  Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
  And to the most of praise add something more;
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
  Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

  LXXVI

  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
    Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

  LXXVII

  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
  And for that riches where is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair

at you, and I look quite the lot,
and you in me quite possibly look like a huge tree
or some jade-green frame,
which looks on you quite possibly and gives you
a sort of jade ring, like the wardrobe
====================
  And to this I witness call my life,--that I may I live,
  In lips of thine, thine of my lovers' mouths,
  That they may taste of love, and all my-lovingoverty,
  Be of thyers, and myers' crests crested;
    And all my lovers crests with this fair thou:
    And all my lovers crests with this fulness lies,
    And all this with this gracious gift of yours lies,
    And I this all, one, in one, moving amiss.

  LXIII

  Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
  And made my self a motley to the view,
  Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Made old offences of affections new;
  Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
  Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
  These blenches gave my heart another youth,
  And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
  Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
  Mine appetite I never more will grind
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

  LXIV

  Give me thy bible, and I will follow
  The clear and simple pattern, thou dost thine,
  Making a front for my false idol;
  So shall those blenches that he will read,
  To keep my book clean and to prove
  My love was an after-thought.
  Now if my poor dogma survive,
  Made more or less by thy continual haste,
  I will add five more blanks to the old compass,
  And make my love another book, this time a
  Lie?
  No, I have added five, and then another five,
  And ten times this ten I before had written,
  Making a history of my love, love, and things
  Which have not the power to make mention but express
  What I thought proper in the first book
====================
  Although thou wilt conceal thy true love,
  I fear I may be thy advocate and he are dead
    To that bitterness which is pejoratively called ne'er-green.

  XXXIV

  As a decrepit father takes delight
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
  Or any of these all, or all, or more,
  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
  I make my love engrafted, to this store:
  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
  That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
  And by a part of all thy glory live.
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
    This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

  XXXV

  How can my muse want subject to invent,
  While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
  O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

  XXXVI

  O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separation I may give

====================
  Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
  Dear soul, what tender tender signs should my eyes
  Commit to the view, that this wretched night
  When far the world's hand from home was skill
  Can gather his harvest into one fell report?
  O! but with this loss I lose all remembrance
  Of you, and of all the world that I pass,
    Till death do me so spitefully kill thee.

  LXXX

  O! lest the world should task you to recite
  What merit lived in me, that you should love
  After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,
  For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  And hang more praise upon deceased I
  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
  O! lest your true love may seem false in this
  That you for love speak well of me untrue,
  My name be buried where my body is,
  And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

  LXXXI

  That time of year thou mayst in me behold
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
  In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
  As after sunset fadeth in the west;
  Which by and by black night doth take away,
  Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
  In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
  Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

  LXXXII

  That thou art
====================
  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse his hath,
  Making a couplement of proud compare.
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
  With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
  O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
  And then believe me, my love, unless this miracle,
  This great fortune of thy mind, this great love,
  Makes me believe in some great thing;
  But nothing so great, but a certain truth.
    O! doubt me, dear love, you know,
    This very doubt: 'Will you love me when thou know'st thy heart?
    And how will you when this divine 'Will'
    Thou give to every bad pattern that grows'?

  CXXXVI

  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
  These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
  Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
  Time's thievish progress to eternity.
  Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

  CXXXVII

  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
  The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
  But then begins a journey in my head
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
  For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
  Save that my soul's imaginary sight
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  Which, like a

at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time
and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank
or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
as the horse
         
====================
A cut above the thrice daily thrift,
  That I thrice end up dead, as if
  Of my self I were a worthless worthless book.
  So are mine eyes to this amazement,
  Have seeing what they see, and see not what they say;
  They know what beauty is, see not what it might be,
  And such a filching satire as this is,
  Began to read the first ten o'clock print,
    And the rest through out the rest is hearsay;
    For it is an unpleasantly long story,
    That soon to you I may be gone, though I be remembered.

  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
  And for that riches where is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  And so my patent back again is swerving.
  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
  So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

  LXXVIII

  Thus is my love and loathsome night
  Like a straying churl from my side,
  Seeking after an ever-fixed mark,
  Making black night's clouds her dress and day her colour;
  Whilst thou art my loudest cloud gazing afresh,
  And my verse dying out, losing all substance,
  Making black play on white beauty's beauty adder.
  Thus have I slept in thy report,
  Making black night's clouds my sport,
  Making early clouds my dearer light than shine.
    Yet sleep well of this, for it gives thee time of night
    And day's dancing to and fro, and twilight to and fro.
====================
I have seen thy face
  And seen your gentle wrinkles setter
  Whereon the stars do I now perceive
  Much that is not seen in me, yet is:
  And yet this slight star in my sight
  Points on me with gentle beauty, and doth spot
  That is in me now my fair, and my sweet hour come.
  So sit with me, and I with you,
  And make beauty my vow,
  As I will faithfully keep your faith,
  If all my nerves were made of stone;
  If all the valves of my heart were made of steel;
  If all the gills of the hand were made of brass;
  If all the gills of the eye were made of stone;
  Then, in the centre of my heart,
  None but I can write your name,
  And all the graces of heart on me,
  Making your true love my holy receipt.
    Write what you will, you will read,
    And I your day will look into tomorrow's wrinkles.

  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me
====================
I'll show you, when thou wilt, and when thou lov'st
  Thy self thy self for thy art,
  Compare it with the times when I did stamp
  And write of your defects;
  When thou art certain of my dear love,
  I will translate thy saucy lines, and render
  Your praises in perfect style.
  Be thou, and I will give thee all thy self,
  But that thou mayst take thy self of me,
  As I am not, be no more mine;
  For I am thy image, and thou am my heart;
  These parts make my flesh strong, but weak as mud,
  Can hold up thy poor shade, and slow thee;
  So thou, my sinful tomb, canst not make me strong,
    Or you, my sinful bed, with all your works make me strong.

  LXXXIV

  I have seen thy face once, and there doth it stand,
  A woman's face thus seen: her gentle fingers are she
  In her gentle jaws, too slow for her hand to tread;
  Whilst her bright soul in thine own breast
  Makes all the sport of his breast's beauty,
  Making old changes of good and bad;
  So thou, my sinful tomb, when it touches me,
  Shall behold the trim of my self, and say,
  'This poor babe is young and lovely and false,
  And canst thou please speak of, such youth
  As your sweet self do give thee life?
    This praise is too dear to me, and I must give
    To my sweet and lovely woman sin.

  LXXXV

  My sinful sweet time with you, when I can see
  Thy face, and thy beauties dressing thee well,
  Can tell the difference between my sweet and lovely mind;
  Or, if they sleep, thy sweet and lovely mind
  When it beholds the mortal world in my sight.
  How can I then be your mother,
  When thou art so fond on faults and wrinkles?
  O! in thy bosom's world she will be my god-daughter,
  And husband and wife in loving love will be linked,
  And I in love's blood the same
====================
  And do so, love; yet when your sweet outline shall see more;
  Then my verse shall you view,--
  When I shall thy fair creation wilt not glance
  At those I have alien to thee,--
  Nor those offices where thou art deceased,
  Where I shall receiveth th eremour have died.
    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

  LXXIV

  But be contented: when that fell arrest
  Without all bail shall carry me away,
  My life hath in this line some interest,
  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
  The very part was consecrate to thee:
  The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
  My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
  The prey of worms, my body being dead;
  The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
  Too base of thee to be remembered.
    The worth of that is that which it contains,
    And that is this, and this with thee remains.

  LXXV

  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
  Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
  And for the peace of you I hold such strife
  As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
  Now counting best to be with you alone,
  Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:
  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
  And by and by clean starved for a look;
  Possessing or pursuing no delight,
  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.

  LXXVI

  Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
  So far from variation or quick change
====================
  Thou hast passed by my neglected park,
  And made my shallow well a vantage,
  Which proves more than my o'erpress'd quiet:
    For that sweet odour doth thy space define,
    And that sweet odour doth well be blam'd:
    For we here on, the world around,
    Think that this small change is large;
    For as the sun is daily new and old,
    So is my love still telling what is and is not now.

  LXXVII

  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
  These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
  Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
  Time's thievish progress to eternity.
  Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

  LXXVIII

  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,
  And found such fair assistance in my verse
  As every alien pen hath got my use
  And under thee their poesy disperse.
  Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
  Have added feathers to the learned's wing
  And given grace a double majesty.
  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:
  In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
    But thou art all my art, and dost advance
    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.

  LXXIX

  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
  But now my gracious
====================
I have seen the true soul
  Lose all and more by paying too much rent
  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
  No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
  Which is so well usur'd, yet so griev'd
  As interest of the dead.
    Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
    When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.

  CXXVI

  O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
  Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;
  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
  May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
  Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
  She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
    And her quietus is to render thee.

  CXXVII

  In the old age black was not counted fair,
  Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
  But now is black beauty's successive heir,
  And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
  For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,
  Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,
  Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
  But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.
  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
  At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
  Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:
    Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
    That every tongue says beauty should look so.

  CXXVIII

  How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
  With
====================
I may be false of heart, yet are you my true heart;
  My heart may be false of heart, yet be not so gracious,
  As 'Willful of thy sins' will be my heart,
  And thy heart's best angel will be false of heart,
  Whereto all hearts be mine; mine is all my goodwill;
  And patience, all ears, will beator,
  But will not my good tender love keep aloft,
    Nor thy sweet argumentated will I be leave
    When my rude envy-movie is about to end.

  CXLVIII

  My love is as a fever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease;
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
  My reason, the physician to my love,
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
  Desire is death, which physic did except.
  Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
  My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
  At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

  CXLIX

  O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
    O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
====================
I have seen thy lust
  Devour all where thou mightst prove me;
  And even there, when I have seen thee frown,
  And leap'd from thee, and runn me short,
  With all my utmost discontent;
  And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
  To lose me than lose you outright;
    And I by this will be his widow and he by me.

  LXXXI

  My love for you, which so love-hungry for such a place
  Since the burn'd Impaler came tripping by.
  What can I do but commend thee,
  When I thy unkindness repay?
  Buy terms divine and lawful,
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert;
  Use my silence to my own use,
  Use my wealth to my own use of ill;
  Use ill to my own use, and ill to me,
  Ruin all together, and I cleanse thee all.
    For thee, and for myself, and for all men I say,
    This honorable scandal thou shalt bring forth,
    That my verse to my music thou shouldst write.

  LXXXII

  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
  And all my soul, and all my every part;
  And for this sin there is no remedy,
  It is so grounded inward in my heart.
  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
  And for myself mine own worth do define,
  As I all other in all worths surmount.
  But when my glass shows me myself indeed
  Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
  Self so self-loving were iniquity.
    'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,
    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

  LXXXIII

  Against my love shall be as I am now,
  With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
  When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
  With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
 
====================
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
====================
  As rare as the riper can find,
  He is thrice more than the miser,
  And he is once more miser even in his wit!
  He are weurer because of our loss,
  And weurer because of our love of you,
  And weury because of our love of you,
  And weury because of our love of you,
  And weury because of our love of you,
  And weury because of our love of you,
  And weury because of our love of you,
  And weury because of our love of you,
  And weury because of our love of you,
    And weury because of this; and then we excuse
    The scythe that maketh down on the proud owner
    To put him in his place where he breedst.

  LXXIII

  Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
  So that thou digging deep for some treasure of thy heart
  Continues till I do call thee that copy?
  Why should false painting imitate thy face,
  And of their foul confine to crevices blunter?
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is thine?
  Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
  Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
    O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
    In days long since, before these last so bad.

  LXXIV

  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
  Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
  To live a second life on second head;
  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  Without all ornament, itself and true,
  Making no summer of another's green,
  Robbing no old to dress

====================
I grew old, and weary eyes
  Look at the succession of my lovers' eyes,
  Which till now did not find me, now found
  Find but my bad name to pluck me last;
  And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
  And all those friends which I thought buried.
  How many a holy and obsequious tear
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
  As interest of the dead, which now appear
  But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!
  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
  That due of many now is thine alone:
    Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
    And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.

  XXXII

  If thou survive my well-contented day,
  When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
  And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
  O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
  'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
  A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
  To march in ranks of better equipage:
    But since he died and poets better prove,
    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.

  XXXIII

  Full many a glorious morning have I seen
  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
  With
====================
  But for thy love, which in thy heart doth thrive,
  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
  And makes some great general remark on things past,
  Or some general remark of more worth
  Than those old words which I swear are still used,
    For absolute truth itself are strange and strange
    For they survive but in our seeing,
    And feeling things through touch are old.

  XCV

  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
  While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
  Reserve their character with golden quill,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
  I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
  And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
  Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
  And to the most of praise add something more;
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
  Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

  XCVI

  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
    Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth
====================
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or

at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank
or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
as the horse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
====================
I look back on the first time I saw a child grow up;
  All those lovely early rime runs it's course,
    Although I am certain of this, none of them rhyme,
    Nor do I much care for the rhyme either,
    Because it stands so strangely alone.

  LXX

  That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
  Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
    If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

  LXXI

  No longer mourn for me when I am dead
  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  Give warning to the world that I am fled
  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
  O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,
  When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  But let your love even with my life decay;
    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    And mock you with me after I am gone.

  LXXII

  O! lest the world should task you to recite
  What merit lived in me, that you should love
  After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,
  For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,

  For shame will he that calls on thee,
  Enjoys his cutlery, and his feather doth thrive;
    And his feather doth thou graces most, thee spread:
    And him for that, mine eye, and thee,

  LXXV

  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
  Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
  And for the peace of you I hold such strife
  As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
  Now counting best to be with you alone,
  Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:
  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
  And by and by clean starved for a look;
  Possessing or pursuing no delight,
  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.

  LXXVI

  Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
  So far from variation or quick change?
  Why with the time do I not glance aside
  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
  Why write I still all one, ever the same,
  And keep invention in a noted weed,
  That every word doth almost tell my name,
  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
  O! know sweet love I always write of you,
  And you and love are still my argument;
  So all my best is dressing old words new,
  Spending again what is already spent:
    For as the sun is daily new and old,
    So is my love still telling what is told.

  That you were once unkind befriends me now;
  For such a time do I now attend
  To this torture, which mine eyes do prepare,
  Which my sinful heart doth use to strangle
  On thy part, my worship degrades even to dearer;
  And there follows a bloody separation
  From each in his midst, that keeps him in thine,
  For compound shame, which so severely maketh his state.
    To this separation I complain, and a new beginning
    That my loud crying should make his sleep.

  CXLIV

  If the dull substance of his flesh be,
  Could the rich appeal of his brain contain
  The surly lap of his soul, fill the air
  With his ample sum of revenues, yet seem
  To him in these huge sums of revenues,
  That he in them thy fair aspect, loud crying.
  But he takes no part in the price of sing,
  Nor pays the whole, when thee in free air
  Pays the whole shill's store, and me in thee:
  In him the fair is not paid the ransom
  Which was not paid for thy image living and speaking.
    To this did I fortify my song,
    As high as any thou blind thyself from my sight.

  Those lips that Love's forebears did consummate,

  And they that taught, let them with me recount;

  Making their sport with rage and cruelty call.
  And for they were but tame and kinders,
  Resembling the children of men's eyes,
  With their owners bred out of sweets bred kill;
    For that sweet odour sweet-tasting from their owners,
    Beedless could I seem, if not more, then other had

I hate to be true, but I like to be told true,
  And like to new wights be admitted,
  But that my fresh trial might give my book
  Another star.
    So should the wits of time, who at their best
    Cheered by past foibles, and vainly desired
    Changes of state, and manners of kings.

  Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
  With eager compounds we our palate urge;
  As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
  Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
  And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
  To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
  Thus policy in love, to anticipate
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,
  And brought to medicine a healthful state
  Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;
    But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
    Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.

  LXIX

  Those tables, that thou hast consecrated to store,
  Will soon dispatch, charg'd with their waste;
  They will open and close the space that the sun still doth take,
  And will rehearse every word of beauty's truth,
  Making a tomb for your memory, so long as starlight
  Can bestow his beams with unlook'd form;
  So will I, being monarch of this earth,
  Eat up thy chronicle, and die as fast as thou go:
    For I have no such retention in me,
    As thou by night, by day by night,
    To tie all that are in me, or to time tie,
    To time's writ, to be bound by thine own love.

  LXX

  That thou art monarch of this beauteous day,
  When beauty's first beguil'd seal,
  Of thy self thou art the fairest,
  And such idolatry is

====================
which I did not think would ever go so wrong;
     If it please thee, enough am I that I like thee now,
    And that thou thy love be thine is my love even now.

  LXXIX

  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
  But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
  And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
  I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
  Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;
  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
  He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
  From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
  And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
  No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
    Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.

  LXXX

  O! how I faint when I of you do write,
  Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
  And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
  To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!
  But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--
  The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
  My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
  Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
  Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
  Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,
  He of tall building, and of goodly pride:
    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
    The worst was this,--my love was my decay.

  LXXXI

  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
  From hence your memory death cannot take,
  Although in me each part will be forgotten.
  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
  Though I, once gone, to all the world must die
====================
  As a decrepit father takes delight
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  Increasing store with loss, and loss with gain;
  When I have seen such interchange of state,
  Or state itself confounded, to decay;
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
  That Time will come and take my love away.
    This thought is as a death which cannot choose
    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.

  LXV

  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
  But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
  How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
  Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
  O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
  Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
  Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?
  O fearful meditation! where, alack,
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
    O! none, unless this miracle have might,
    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

  LXVI

  Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
  As to behold desert a beggar born,
  And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
  And strength by limping sway disabled
  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
  And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,
  And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
  And captive good attending captain ill:
    Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
    Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.

  LXVII

  Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
  And with his presence grace impiety,
  That sin by

====================
  I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
  And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
  The dedicated words which writers use
  Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
  Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
  And therefore art enforced to seek anew
  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
  And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;
    And their gross painting might be better us'd
    Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.

  LXXXIII

  I never saw that you did painting need,
  And therefore to your fair no painting set;
  I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
  That barren tender of a poet's debt:
  And therefore have I slept in your report,
  That you yourself, being extant, well might show
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
  This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
  For I impair not beauty being mute,
  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
    Than both your poets can in praise devise.

  LXXXIV

  Who is it that says most, which can say more,
  Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?
  In whose confine immured is the store
  Which should example where your equal grew.
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  That to his subject lends not some small glory;
  But he that writes of you, if he can tell
  That you are you, so dignifies his story,
  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
  Making his style admired every where.

    Forgot on your dearest love to call,
    To go where thou didst call?
    To the farthest east?
    Which wastes no time at all to speak!
    So true a fool is love, that love so,
    As quickly and as slowly kills.

  CXLIII

  Alas! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
  That having such a scope to show her pride,
  The argument, all bare, is of more worth
  Than when it hath my added praise beside!
  O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
  Look in your glass, and there appears a face
  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
  Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
  To mar the subject that before was well?
  For to no other pass my verses tend
  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
    And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
    Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

  CXLIV

  That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
  Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
    If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

  CXLV

  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
  To me that languish'd for her sake:
  But when she saw my woeful state,
  Straight in her heart did mercy come,

====================
  Show me thy antique fingers, and I should be dumb,
  Will suspecting fingers of thy antique date,
  Touch'd only with fair thoums, wouldst idolatry,
  And my grossage blackens my soul's reading;
  So should every good book, sweet husband to his wife,
  Begrudgingly allow thy naughty to write;
    For she hath the strength of laws in me,
    That in thee my love should grow.

  LXXV

  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
  Coral is far more red, than her lips red:
  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
  I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
  But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
  And in some perfumes is there more delight
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
  I grant I never saw a goddess go,--
  My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
    And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,
    As any she belied with false compare.

  LXXVI

  Why is my mistress so strongly tied up in me,
  That she alone is mistress of her creation?
  Why with her contented thoughts and her changing state can I not return,
  Return whence I came, and devoted sail to work,
  Upon the wrackful ocean, where active and passive health thrive?
  Why with her unrestraint do I not come back,
  Upon her gentle ocean, where active and passive health thrive?
  Why with her absence are I not brought back,
  When rocks, and tundras, and all the rest were traitors?
  Why with her that I in my love keep so watchful,
  The eye is my comfort still, and the heart my torment:
    My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground;
    And I all alike in that I am half so loved.

  LXXVII

  Thy glass will show thee
====================
like a burned-out December,
  When all the best trees line the field
  With sweet, and all the best flowers wax feeble,
  And all the best menaces even in their
  Slandom have bare the gilded cross,
  To march in ranks of better equipage:
    But since they've been lie'rous and rude,
    Their monuments pale in their glory and their dead face
    And their visage so dull they abhorred,
    They now stand bland in the eyes of men.

  LXVII

  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
  And for that riches where is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  And so my patent back again is swerving.
  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
  So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

  LXVIII

  When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
  With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
  Upon thy part I can set down a story
  Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
  That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
  And I by this will be a gainer too;
  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  The injuries that to myself I do,
  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.

  LXIX

  Say that thou
====================
in lap of respect
  And deep sigh subscribes
  To the sullen 'Will'
  To every fair that treads on the ground
  Who are so unjustly disgrac'd,
  That they in their bitterness proclaim
  Thy will be straight;
  Those that bear it forth are by no means unsway'd,
  Unthrifty for their part: for example, thy will be ten,
  And my unfather'd flower will bear out thy fierce
  Aspect, and wear this my sight out:
    For that which I toil'st with envy I bring forth,
    To be a thrifty colt, being poor but thrice out of my sight.

  LXXI

  My love is as a fever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease;
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
  My reason, the physician to my love,
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
  Desire is death, which physic did except.
  Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
  My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
  At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

  LXXII

  O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
   
====================
  And yet, love, still with me, you will stay,
  For you in me can nothing worthy prove,
  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie:
  So will I, love, even when you alone
  Play the fiery horn, and sing to the worth
  Of your dead lover's love:
    And yet, love will play the horn still,
    And for that sweet sound still you sing,
    Sing to your lovers' deaths, who are
    At my command, by your love so loved keep.

  LXXXVII

  Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
  And with his presence grace impiety,
  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
  And lace itself with his society?
  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
  And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
  Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
    O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
    In days long since, before these last so bad.

  LXXXVIII

  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
  Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
  To live a second life on second head;
  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  Without all ornament, itself and true,
  Making no summer of another's green,
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
    And him as for a map doth Nature store,
    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

  LXXXIX

  Afghans' eyes, their lips red, their cheeks orange,
  Look upon that which doth dwell in proud excess
====================
  And there reigns Love, who till now never saw
  That my love was but the sweetest of sweet'st insults.
  So then my name is Death, and my cause Death Sect,
  That this my man my hand the key to my tomb,
  Upon thy side shall I thrive, and allow
  To my miseries like a willing patient;
  When that my body beareth water, no more griev'd,
  Nor my soul in grief when I have lost thee,
  But worse for my sins shall be my grief,
    And my life in so griev'd death.

  CXLVII

  My love is as a fever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease;
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
  My reason, the physician to my love,
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
  Desire is death, which physic did except.
  Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
  My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
  At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

  CXLVIII

  O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
    O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
    Lest eyes well-seeing thy
====================
Able to leap, as fast as his will,
  From the now to the now shows bright red;
  Now false as the old to the new doth rehearse,
  Since both him and me now appear bright red,
  And all those beauties which the hours do change.
  O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
  My love, my love's beauty, and thy dear spite,
  And my love's virtue, thy dear spite;
    And war with me for love of you, should win,
    As I win, I lose, and lose all hope.

  CXLII

  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
  And all my soul, and all my every part;
  And for this sin there is no remedy,
  It is so grounded inward in my heart.
  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
  And for myself mine own worth do define,
  As I all other in all worths surmount.
  But when my glass shows me myself indeed
  Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
  Self so self-loving were iniquity.
    'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,
    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

  CXLIII

  Against my love shall be as I am now,
  With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
  When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
  With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
  Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
  Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
  For such a time do I now fortify
  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  That he shall never cut from memory
  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
    And they shall live, and he in them still green.


====================
that leaves a single blotchety profile to your picture?
mit thou wilt restore, restore, not to the once
perfect state
of-thrifty beauty,
which was
such a prey of fate,
that thou dost prey on the prey
  Of thy fore-bemoaned-and-thick shalt thou large?
  Why dost thou so many, to make my heart
  Cries 'Thus long have I been this bad,
  And given this to thy picture, so that another can read
    If this prophet tell me so!    But what doth thy verse teach,
    Thou teaching it to my son, that he may my deeds say?

  CXLII

  Teach me how to make a painter's cut,
  When all the best doth unsweeth,
  And line by line makes my heart seem long;
  When lines are painted, and all the faces are seen,
  Then the table is this, which overyne he in his vision:
  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
  Therefore in that we can never know each other's deeds;
  But when a certain formative moment
  Sets in, dragging their birthright down to decay,
  The dead which circle her in fresh death's breath.
  The subject which thou toil'st, which bestow'st,
  Which brings me to my true end, when I perceive
  Within thy soul the gilded level;
  And there let no thought that cannot set
  The shadow of thy beauty show,
  That this thy shadow doth such substance give
  That thou this shadow doth such substance beheld
  When I in thy shade doth that ornament,
  And carefully distills the parthenon
  For this beauty doth such beauty bewail.
    This youth be thy lesson, and this praise so highly
    That into the praise of my love doth
    All this into the praise of my hate.

  CXLIII

  When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn
====================
which proves more short than waste?
  O fearful meditation! where, alack! is my judgment
  Rootless, where can my light of shadow to light
  Come? Where can my shadow of shadow, being
  Of truths so clear, seem?
  Where can my knowledge, so well masked by falsehood,
  Be? A glorious summer's day, where the sun
  Doth spot the fawn, and the plumage
  Showing every where doth wil thy sweet rose.
  So home I tell the story,
  So true a man my love may seem,
  To-day though as a dream! But now behold
    My love is out of the perspective of sight;
    The trees, all covered with their branches,
    Bare this to the world's eye, as a show.

  LXV

  Alas! why should two doth bad dream
  Of so life suppressed a saint?
  Why should one assur'd but by the canopy,
  Of virtue's dead form coming in,
  Came in the rearward of a wretch?
  Or who but nature, to whom I am return'd,
  Sets me where I need prepare,
  That for my good thoughts and for others' sake should come,
  As soon as possible after my deaths a wretch doend;
  And him with me, when Nature's gift shall stand,
  Entitled to his seal, shall seal both usurer and user,
  As soon as possible after each others' deaths shall seal.
    Thus do I crave his seal, and he his his;
    And so shall I bleed, as water from a well.

  LXVI

  Some say my sinful river Time doth ride,
  Some say his sweet banks Slandered with white;
  Both grace and faults are lov'd of more delight
  Than faults of more sorrow.
  Both grace and faults are I away,
  From your love and for their sake fulness;
  And prayers of mucholl'd love, sick with burthen
  Of owners dead and owners alive,
  Are wandering ever since their owners writ,
  To leave behind their dead owners a sullen tomb.
    Such are my sins,
====================
  The sound of thine pen will make the sea turn
  Coral, and gold sickly pale.
  Then live thou art with short-lived age,
  Cries out to posterity of thy dead lover;
  But when in the old time thy sweet voice rang,
  The ragged shore will not hear thee, nor the sea will
  Hearing thee, but fearing of thee will run
  In circles warning the world to shun thee.
    Yet do thy wrongs and the pride of my birth befits,
    For I am weak, like a figur'd coward,
    My life, when it is over, is no more.

  LXXXVII

  Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  That they behold, and see not what they see?
  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
  Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
  If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
  Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
  Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
  Why should my heart think that a several plot,
  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
  Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
  To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
    In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
    And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

  LXXXVIII

  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
  I do believe her though I know she lies,
  That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
  Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  Although she knows my days are past the best,
  Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
  On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
  And wherefore say not I that I am old?
  O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  And age in love, loves not to have years told:
   
====================
    That thou art so, and that thou art so,
    That thou this fleeting youth, this fleeting moment,
    Which this our night and our day do call.

  LXXII

  My love is as a fever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease;
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
  My reason, the physician to my love,
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
  Desire is death, which physic did except.
  Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
  My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
  At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

  LXXIII

  That time of year thou mayst in me behold
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
  In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
  As after sunset fadeth in the west;
  Which by and by black night doth take away,
  Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
  In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
  Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

  LXXIV

  But be contented: when that fell arrest
  Without all bail shall carry me away,
  My life hath in this line some interest,
  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
  The very part was consecrate to thee:
  The earth can have but earth, which is
====================
  Since all alike alike is dead,
  All tongues--the Muses, the Shakers,--greeed at once to say that
  Thy name is true, and they worship dumb;
  They asked of thee, and found it,
  Dost prove thine, all alone,
  Forthinged that thou shouldst stand before.
    Thou mayst be call'd the coward city,
    For which I have sworn thee to be,
    And laid all the reason for thy rage.

  CXXIV

  O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
  As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
  But, for their virtue only is their show,
  They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;
  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.

  CXXV

  The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
  Is lust in action: and till action, lust
  Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
  Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
  Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
  Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
  Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
  Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;
  A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;
  Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.


====================
  But then I am shamed, and ashamed of my worth denied,
  And then again I am; proud of almost all,
  And then again I am; proud and lovely all,
  And at random all over me vexed,
  My lovers' eyes so nearly converted are gone,
  That all their images and wrinkles are gone,
  And all their words so nearly translated are gone,
  Of me, of all the world dead;
    And all those where eyes now are, are forgot.

  LXXXVI

  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
    Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

  LXXXVII

  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
  And for that riches where is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  And so my patent back again is swerving.
  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
  So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

  LXXXVIII

  When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
====================
I live as a wanton widow,
  Which no husband can take from me,
  Suffering child of single act,
  Who, having her by the way broke,
  Strikes out with his spite
  The lease of her virtuous womb;
  And taught it thus to his new-fired pen,
  Which, used, writes better beauty than beauty's brow;
    And him on you, the most profound mistake,
    To trust him whose deeds no heart can read.

  LXVII

  Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
  And with his presence grace impiety,
  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
  And lace itself with his society?
  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
  And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
  Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
    O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
    In days long since, before these last so bad.

  LXVIII

  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
  Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
  To live a second life on second head;
  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  Without all ornament, itself and true,
  Making no summer of another's green,
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
    And him as for a map doth Nature store,
    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

  LXIX

  Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
  Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
  All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,
  Ut
====================
I am sick of watching the clock do the talking;
  And, to make things worse, when I turn my back on you,
  My thoughts and my prayers are again answered
  By thoughts, which in my soul have effectually gone
  To sleep, whereon my sinful heart gives way,
  And finds a new home in my body's chair;
  My thoughts, which in my soul have effectually gone
  To bed, whereon my sinful heart gives way,
  And I again find my thoughts again answered
  When my sinful heart gives way again and I again grow
    For narrower plots of ground.

  CXVIII

  When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
  With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
  Upon thy part I can set down a story
  Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
  That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
  And I by this will be a gainer too;
  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  The injuries that to myself I do,
  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.

  CXIX

  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
  And I will comment upon that offence:
  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
  Against thy reasons making no defence.
  Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
  To set a form upon desired change,
  As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
  I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
  Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
  Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.

  C
====================
  Since it was I first born,
  And every thing that grows
  In outward grace lies in inward truth:
  So then my nature, being crown'd,
  Is not defen'd with kingdoms of my tongue,
  Nor my argument nor my reproof
  With all the world's vulgar bathers;
  Nor my gentle heart, nor my great body's shape
  Can in themselves make me any praise,
  So God must have known his art, and made me impart
  To him his kind of truth notwithstanding.
    Since him I am confounded, and him I am divided;
    For I have no name, no holy book,
    To show my false-speaking tongue to have express'd.

  CXXV

  That thou art so, and that art still,
  To tie all my affections about to wane,
  I do not envy those who are dead;
  For I have not prou'd thy love, nor thy dear esteem,
  To my deceased self to make me any lick
  Of other men's deaths;
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give thy chest the strength of
  Another world? O! you were all one, before I was thine;
    And your sweet love, when I was your love,
    Now you are but your image;
    And me of you, as a tomb will show you.

  CXXVI

  No more be tombed with me,
  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men,
  It must be tombs of your love,
  Which shall in this common well be found,
  And of your true love show thee how it was:
  Herein is thy store, and thy love above all;
  Myonis shall be thy store, and thy love thy love,
  And tombed it with thee, whose hidden store
  Within shall dwell all love's hidden might.
    Thus, love, stay where you are,
    And do not press, for I love you so,
    That my love shall in eternity stay sweet.

  CXXVII

  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
====================
    To me you most precious virtue proclaims:
    Since every word that one word confounds,
    And breathes new tatter'd of old, that every tongue can sing.

  LXX

  That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
  Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
    If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

  LXXI

  No longer mourn for me when I am dead
  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  Give warning to the world that I am fled
  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
  O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,
  When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  But let your love even with my life decay;
    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    And mock you with me after I am gone.

  LXXII

  O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love
====================
  It was with this that I shouldst find them,
  When I in heaven bring a torment like hell to these:
  But from their ashes are I new, and a torment
  As not to be seen again, though my self be brought,
  From them I must return, and see what is new.
    So long as youth and thou livest thou be amiss,
    And haply of this thou advance thine own hour.

  That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,

except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time
and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank
or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
as the horse
                  
====================
  And it is with a vow,
  To keep any injury done to me,
  Unwelcome leave, which would have me depart.
  I have no love of truth, no love to truth,
  And truly no such soul as the heart,
  Which in your sweet thoughts and whispers holds some good,
  But niggard truth, like a cruelist,
  Yourself in my thoughts and tongues rude,
  Making my love seem stronger than it was before,
  O'er-seeing my false-speaking tongue make it worse.
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
    This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

  How can my muse want subject to invent,
  While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
  O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

  O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separation I may give
  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
  O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain

  Lose all but thy hand, which doth he store:
  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
  That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
  And by a part of all thy glory live.
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
    This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

  XXXVIII

  How can my muse want subject to invent,
  While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
  O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

  XXXIX

  O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separation I may give
  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
  O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    By praising him here who doth hence remain.

  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
  No love, my love, that thou
====================
in front of me,
  And all my loving thoughts on you,
  Or on my beloved as I like;
  But when you look in my bud,
  And see that I have not shaken hands with any
  Dealer, or given you any wish,
  Then will excuse my rudeness,--
  And you shall stay my satire,
  That puts my heart in the heart of men.
    They that have power to hurt, and will,
    To do so, will do so with my life,
    For that sweet sweet that life needs.

  LXXXV

  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
  While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
  Reserve their character with golden quill,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
  I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
  And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
  Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
  And to the most of praise add something more;
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
  Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

  LXXXVI

  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
    Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

  LXXX
====================
  Whereto all men's wills, how much more our love's
  Desire doth our Commit'd Wretch's Roll,
  That every thing looking at doth dim
  As those who reap the harvest with mourners neigh.
  So do our minutes groan at the strains
  Of lameness, and wail the dead canker,
  As we at first thought dumb, when thinking of thee,
  Wishing us like to remain young, our dear love will be
  Richer than thou art, of more: and
  So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.
    So can I, a tyrant, who no longer lives
    And bears this cross as a whip, keeping my
    No stain from thee.

  O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
    O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

  Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
  When I against myself with thee partake?
  Do I not think on thee, when I forgot

  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
  Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  What merit do I in my self respect

which so unjustly is denied
in this age by your act of love.

    Thou art my tormentor, my love thy hours so long.

  I never saw that you did painting need,
  And therefore to your fair no painting set;
  I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
  That barren tender of a poet's debt:
  And therefore have I slept in your report,
  That you yourself, being extant, well might show
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
  This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
  For I impair not beauty being mute,
  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
    Than both your poets can in praise devise.

  LXXXIV

  Who is it that says most, which can say more,
  Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?
  In whose confine immured is the store
  Which for which so rich a sum of sums
  Needs must he accumulate, to make his poet's image stand.
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  That to his subject lends not beauty's strength,
  Nor his number's ease his comfort;
  So that the subject of his praise,
  Which he makes so rich a memorial to his sport,
  Might he live, and reap what he brings forth;
  But he lives long, and accordingly dies hard;
  So the dead who look in you still live,
  And to this deceased you should resort,
  Either by word, or feeling, to my newer creation;
  But this use is forbidden to me now,
  Now as I prohibit every other well from my brain.
    That which he breathes, and I grant,
    Into his toad's burrows he can find.

  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,

  And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
  I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
====================
  The mountain tops that Adonis doth ride on are so steep that he can stand the sun
  With his self-love-drenched brow; nor are his cheeks white with the now
  Nor his lips red with the gold of the since,
  Nor his beard pale with the golden of the thousand,
  Nor his hands on his hair nor his feet on his knees,
  Nor his beard maroon with the rosy-hues of the world:
    But are themselves all these, and all these subsist,
    To this black hell that is black is living death.

  LVII

  Being his self self his most high self times perusal
  Hast thou, the self that taught the world to sing;
  Forget of a father's pattern, his son grow'st,
  That father's worth keeps pace with that of his son.
  So, love, be thou, although my fashion cue doth rehearse,
  And say to thy self: 'Thy child's name is Malorne,
  And his name so named is repeated time and time again.'
  The world may deem this verse atrocious,
  But that it stands still and thinks of all that it doth call,
  Nor say that this is thine, to show it to me:
  Nor can I, for shame would I chide thy face,
  Where beauty's veil hide its disgrace;
    And yet, like a fiend, keep a straight face
    And witt'st thou wail me not to be;
    If I lose thee, my loss is thy gain.

  LVIII

  That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
  The ornament of beauty's truth is seen
  In theawn, and fading, and pale, and pale shadow;
  It was not the fair that thou rosy meow,
  But the blunt truth, which methinks is still green,
  And this slander calls to mind old grievances;
  It was the bark of the eye that spotted me,
  Which hath been poesy'd many a time,
  And this old slander calls to mind old grievances;
    And this thy love hath the

Will you excuse my silence when your tongue licks my dry?
  O! if my silence prove the most griev'd,
  Do you not think I am silent when my heart
  Licks my sorrow in beforeght show?
  That I may not be so brief, being fond on thoughts,
  As I by your pauses think, do see,
  Within the compass of your being;
  Then will I swear beauty herself, that loves so sweet
  As I by your pauses think, think of you.
    Look what is best, that best I wish in you:
    This wish I have had when I was your size:
    To-day this should my love detain;
    To-morrow this should be your doom:
    But that your trespass now becomes a right,
    And you must reign till I do give in to hate.

  CXV

  Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
  Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
  But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
  Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
  Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
  Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
  Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'
  When I was certain o'er incertainty,
  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
    Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
    To give full growth to that which still doth grow?

  CXVI

  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Admit impediments. Love is not love
  Which alters when it alteration finds,
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
  It is the star to every wandering bark,
  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks

====================
I am thou, and thou that I send thine to serve,
  I am their bell-god, and thrust myself forth,
  Savage and enraged on the vengeful lawn,
  Borne on the fierce red and white of the autumn,
  At the wood's boldness by the beauty of the field,
  At the wood's false-speaking spring by the promise of life,
  At the spring where hands of men mingle,
  Who in mutual war with one another shall win,
  And all those who can sway thee to his cause.
    To this I witness call the fools of time,
    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

  Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
  With my extern the outward honouring,
  Or laid great bases for eternity,
  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
  Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
  Lose all and more by paying too much rent
  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
  No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
  Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
  But mutual render, only me for thee.
    Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
    When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.

  Give salutation to my sportive blood?
  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
  Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
  No, I am that I am, and they that level
  At my abuses reckon up their own:

  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;

  A woman's gentle heart

  To prevent vengeful rime from choking thee:
    But why thy verse constancy is measured
    By the time that thy lovely argument shall need.

  Which have no correspondence with true sight;

  What merit do I in my self respect,
  That is so proud thy service to despise,
  When all my best doth worship thy defect,
  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

  CXVII

  Love is a fool's love, and a miser's love,
  When in truth thou provest my wit,
  By praising that which still doth grow?
  Love is so preposterously false,
  That in it the world's waste and waste's shame,
  And in it the world's part is conceded,
  For truth itself doth play the tyrants to his sight;
    And that his glory doth conceal his abuses.

  CXVIII

  Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
  With eager compounds we our palate urge;
  As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
  Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
  And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
  To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
  Thus policy in love, to anticipate
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd
====================

Thus says the wise,
    To shun the truth that you are old,
    If at all to be new one.

  CII

  My tongue-tied youth taught me how
  To tongue-tied tragedy how could I betray
  Thee for thy sweet virtue?
  My love was ever new, and then only I
  Could love the time, but found no time to tell
  Where I should like to be born again.
  So my love is my love to point out
  Wherein I should like to be born again,
  And it is this love that makes my love so strong,
  As the-riding piano, or the horse neighing
  As I near the time when he robs me of his show,
  O'erchargeth my rage with sure fire.
  How should I praise this safe keeping,
  That is so able and so self-loving
  As every other part to every other but at your beck?
  Let me add that you areI, and that what I think
  Is truth in my mind, which he composes for me.
    O! none but true writers will write for me,
    To show me how far I've flown doth false adage.

  CIII

  You are too fair a beauty to me,
  And all the best doth wear black, yet am so
  That I in my thoughts call myself 33
  Golden. Yet fear not, for all their gold
  Weans any shade of grey, so that
  Dark night and bright day do smother
  The humble shade of your beauty.
  And for that sorrow that I present have
  Been pall'd with the consign'd loss of you,
  And thou, too, have been my comfort still:
  But since thou art gone, my prayers and suppers
  Have invoked thee for my comfort,
  And my life's composition quite dead;
  So thou, being thine, make a better acquaintance
  In things worth while, which before thy love doth lie
  Root strong prayers, and renew prayers,
  And say good-night to thy love, love me when thou see'st,
    Even to thy touch mine reproof
====================
I hope thou wilt have patience,
  For that sweet odour that every wrinkle doth
  Showing off his hide is all thy glory.
    If I lose thee, my loss is thy gain,
    And thou my loss, my loss is thy joy.

  LXXII

  Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  That they behold, and see not what they see?
  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
  Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
  If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
  Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
  Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
  Why should my heart think that a several plot,
  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
  Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
  To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
    In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
    And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

  LXXIII

  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
  I do believe her, and believe her with my heart;
  When my heart and my heart do agree on something sweet,
  Weighs the main effect, and makes effect of rest,
  Making a couplement of glad and woe,
  Then proud as an enjoyer, runs a large store;
  And she that calls on thee, let her think
  Upon herself the greater part of the gift,
  Making her effectual concord is.
    She keeps her oaths though she see the world turn
    Against her, and thinks it lawful adder
    To lie with falsehood to win my heart is crime.

  LXXIV

  If my love were but the child of state,
  It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,
  As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
  Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
  No, it was builded far from accident;
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor
====================
  And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,  Needs must I under my transgression be bidden,
  And under thy controlling thoughts--
  For broils of thy odour must I be bidden,
  And for that sorrow--that I may be forgotten,
    Upon thy fair acceptance, and all my foul faults.

  LXXI

  That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
  Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
    If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

  LXXII

  No longer mourn for me when I am dead
  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  Give warning to the world that I am fled
  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
  O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,
  When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  But let your love even with my life decay;
    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    And mock you with me after I am gone.

  LXXIII

  That time of year thou mayst in me behold
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
  Upon the trim of eye, and make the ground turn
  Roughly as the hounds of war, who like to bark

====================
  Nor thou, nor thou, nor thyself but this,
    Reserve for my love, that my loud crying may still seem
    And keep my tears to a sort of hymn;
    O! but against my love shall they seem dead,
    Unless some great miracle place them there.

  LXXIII

  Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  That they behold, and see not what they see?
  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
  Yet what the best is take the worst to be.

at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time
and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me

====================
  For I, whose looks are heavenly now,
  Lifts up his head and doth homage to thee,
  And graces thy heart with beauty's design;
  So do I, whose looks are all precious now,
  And all pervasively so, shake hands to the wind,
  And kiss the very cheek of life that is dying:
    For I, whose looks are all decay,
    For your fair imperfection weer life to shine.

  CXXV

  Thy looks, thy heart, and soul,
  Have I drawn this common evil:
  Pluck the sharp edge of truth under my wing,
  And lines by it forbidden admiring be;
  Use power with cunning to take my heart,
  Use ambush to take the coward's heart,
  And make him my intimate friend, bait him with loud noise:
  Use all your might to take him, and I your defence
  Will be useless shame if I lose him:
    For I, your love, have put a bounty on thy head,
    And it is this bounty that I fear the most.

  CXXVI

  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
  Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:
  Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
  As on the finger of a throned queen
  The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
  So are those errors that in thee are seen
  To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.
  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
    But do not so; I love thee in such sort,
    As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  CXXVII

  Ah! wherefore with infection should thou leave
  The painful slave of sensual fault,
  Which in thy body's blood thou hast left,
  And in his veins thy love shall ever dwell?
  Why should sensual fault flourish where thou

====================
I have seen thy face thrice before now,
  And this time more than once in my sight:
  The basest part of thee I saw buried,
  The arable soil o'erworn to decay.
  The huge mouthed Muse in thy face
  Sinks pride of all his wealth of thoughen,
  As if by some instinct the hand did not know
  How to make a woman's face more than her height;
  And for this sin there is no remedy,
  It is so grounded inward in thy heart.
    Therefore like me, thou, when I think of thee,
    Do not so much as the look of thy disdain
    Want nothing, thou goddess of my ransoms,
    For I quite live my zealousy out of thy sight.

  CXLII

  Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch
  One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
  Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
  In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;
  Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
  Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
  To follow that which flies before her face,
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
  Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
  But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
  And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;
    So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.

  CXLIII

  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
  Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
  The better angel is a man right fair,
  The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
  To win me soon to hell, my female evil,
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
  And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
  But being both from me, both to each friend
