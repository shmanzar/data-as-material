<span> is </span> <span> even </span> <span> more </span> <span> fun </span> <span> than </span> <span> going </span> <span> to </span> <span> San </span> <span> Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne
or </span> <span> being </span> <span> sick </span> <span> to </span> <span> my </span> <span> stomach </span> <span> on </span> <span> the </span> <span> Travesera </span> <span> de </span> <span> Gracia </span> <span> in </span> <span> Barcelona
partly </span> <span> because </span> <span> in </span> <span> your </span> <span> orange </span> <span> shirt </span> <span> you </span> <span> look </span> <span> like </span> <span> a </span> <span> better </span> <span> happier </span> <span> St. Sebastian
partly </span> <span> because </span> <span> of </span> <span> my </span> <span> love </span> <span> for </span> <span> you, partly </span> <span> because </span> <span> of </span> <span> your </span> <span> love </span> <span> for </span> <span> yoghurt
partly </span> <span> because </span> <span> of </span> <span> the </span> <span> fluorescent </span> <span> orange </span> <span> tulips </span> <span> around </span> <span> the </span> <span> birches
partly </span> <span> because </span> <span> of </span> <span> the </span> <span> secrecy </span> <span> our </span> <span> smiles </span> <span> take </span> <span> on </span> <span> before </span> <span> people </span> <span> and </span> <span> statuary
it </span> <span> is </span> <span> hard </span> <span> to </span> <span> believe </span> <span> when </span> <span> I’m </span> <span> with </span> <span> you </span> <span> that </span> <span> there </span> <span> can </span> <span> be </span> <span> anything </span> <span> as </span> <span> still
as </span> <span> solemn </span> <span> as </span> <span> unpleasantly </span> <span> definitive </span> <span> as </span> <span> statuary </span> <span> when </span> <span> right </span> <span> in </span> <span> front </span> <span> of </span> <span> it
in </span> <span> the </span> <span> warm </span> <span> New </span> <span> York </span> <span> 4 </span> <span> o’clock </span> <span> light </span> <span> we </span> <span> are </span> <span> drifting </span> <span> back </span> <span> and </span> <span> forth
between </span> <span> each </span> <span> other </span> <span> like </span> <span> a </span> <span> tree </span> <span> breathing </span> <span> through </span> <span> its </span> <span> spectacles

and </span> <span> the </span> <span> portrait </span> <span> show </span> <span> seems </span> <span> to </span> <span> have </span> <span> no </span> <span> faces </span> <span> in </span> <span> it </span> <span> at </span> <span> all, just </span> <span> paint
you </span> <span> suddenly </span> <span> wonder </span> <span> why </span> <span> in </span> <span> the </span> <span> world </span> <span> anyone </span> <span> ever </span> <span> did </span> <span> them
                                                                                                              I </span> <span> look
at </span> <span> you </span> <span> and </span> <span> I </span> <span> would </span> <span> rather </span> <span> look </span> <span> at </span> <span> you </span> <span> than </span> <span> all </span> <span> the </span> <span> portraits </span> <span> in </span> <span> the </span> <span> world
except </span> <span> possibly </span> <span> for </span> <span> the </span> <span> Polish </span> <span> Rider </span> <span> occasionally </span> <span> and </span> <span> anyway </span> <span> it’s </span> <span> in </span> <span> the </span> <span> Frick
which </span> <span> thank </span> <span> heavens </span> <span> you </span> <span> haven’t </span> <span> gone </span> <span> to </span> <span> yet </span> <span> so </span> <span> we </span> <span> can </span> <span> go </span> <span> together </span> <span> for </span> <span> the </span> <span> first </span> <span> time
and </span> <span> the </span> <span> fact </span> <span> that </span> <span> you </span> <span> move </span> <span> so </span> <span> beautifully </span> <span> more </span> <span> or </span> <span> less </span> <span> takes </span> <span> care </span> <span> of </span> <span> Futurism
just </span> <span> as </span> <span> at </span> <span> home </span> <span> I </span> <span> never </span> <span> think </span> <span> of </span> <span> the </span> <span> Nude </span> <span> Descending </span> <span> a </span> <span> Staircase </span> <span> or
at </span> <span> a </span> <span> rehearsal </span> <span> a </span> <span> single </span> <span> drawing </span> <span> of </span> <span> Leonardo </span> <span> or </span> <span> Michelangelo </span> <span> that </span> <span> used </span> <span> to </span> <span> wow </span> <span> me
and </span> <span> what </span> <span> good </span> <span> does </span> <span> all </span> <span> the </span> <span> research </span> <span> of </span> <span> the </span> <span> Impressionists </span> <span> do </span> <span> them
when </span> <span> they </span> <span> never </span> <span> got </span> <span> the </span> <span> right </span> <span> person </span> <span> to </span> <span> stand </span> <span> near </span> <span> the </span> <span> tree </span> <span> when </span> <span> the </span> <span> sun </span> <span> sank
or </span> <span> for </span> <span> that </span> <span> matter </span> <span> Marino </span> <span> Marini </span> <span> when </span> <span> he </span> <span> didn’t </span> <span> pick </span> <span> the </span> <span> rider </span> <span> as </span> <span> carefully
as </span> <span> the </span> <span> horse
                               it </span> <span> seems </span> <span> they </span> <span> were </span> <span> all </span> <span> cheated </span> <span> of </span> <span> some </span> <span> marvelous </span> <span> experience
which </span> <span> is </span> <span> not </span> <span> going </span> <span> to </span> <span> go </span> <span> wasted </span> <span> on </span> <span> me </span> <span> which </span> <span> is </span> <span> why </span> <span> I’m </span> <span> telling </span> <span> you </span> <span> about </span> <span> it </span>
